# Zoom Integration Documentation

## Overview
The Zoom integration in EduRaise allows teachers to conduct virtual classes through Zoom meetings. The system manages Zoom accounts, meeting creation, and access control for both teachers and students. When an admin assigns a program to a teacher, they automatically get access to manage virtual classes for that program.

2. **ZoomMeeting**
   - Represents a scheduled Zoom meeting
   - Links to the teacher and educational program
   - Stores meeting details (topic, start time, duration, meeting ID, join URL)
   - Automatically associated with assigned programs
