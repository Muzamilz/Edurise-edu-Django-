- Example: `implementation-F1-user-authentication.md`

### File Structure
Each implementation file contains:
1. Implementation Context
   - Feature summary
   - User workflow overview
   - Technical context
   - Integration points
   - Success criteria
   - Architecture diagram
   - Technical approach
   - Dependencies

2. Structured To-Do List
   - Hierarchical task structure
   - Technically precise subtasks
   - Implementation details
   - Testing requirements

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: Django Templates, Bootstrap 5
- Backend: Django 5.2
- Database: SQLite (Development), PostgreSQL (Production)
- Authentication: Django Authentication System
- File Storage: Django Storage
- Testing: Django Test Framework
