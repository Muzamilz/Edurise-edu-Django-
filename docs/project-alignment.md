# Project Alignment with Implementation Plan

## Current Project Structure Analysis

### Backend (Django Apps)
The project currently has the following Django apps:
- `accounts`: Handles user authentication and profiles
- `form_builder`: Form creation and management
- `ai_builder`: AI-related functionality
- `ai_analytics`: Analytics features

### Frontend (Vue.js)
The frontend is structured with:
- Vue.js 3 with Vite
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Standard Vue.js directory structure (components, views, stores, etc.)

## Required Changes to Match Implementation Plan

### 1. Backend App Structure
We need to create new Django apps to match the implementation plan:

```bash
python manage.py startapp courses
python manage.py startapp blog
python manage.py startapp testimonials
python manage.py startapp payments
python manage.py startapp communications
```

### 2. Frontend Structure Updates
The frontend needs to be reorganized to match the feature phases:

```src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/           # Authentication features
│   ├── courses/        # Course management
│   ├── blog/          # Blog system
│   ├── testimonials/  # Testimonials
│   ├── admin/         # Admin dashboard
│   ├── payments/      # Payment system
│   └── communications/# Communication system
```
