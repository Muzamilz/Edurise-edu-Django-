# Zoom Integration Scenarios for Teachers and Students

## Overview
This document outlines recommended scenarios for how teachers and students interact with Zoom integration in the EduRise platform, especially in relation to programs, meetings, templates, and bulk scheduling.

---

## 1. Teacher Scenarios

### A. Creating and Managing Meetings
- **Teachers** can create Zoom meetings for their assigned programs.
- When creating a meeting, a teacher selects the program, sets the topic, time, and duration.
- Meetings are automatically linked to the selected program and visible to enrolled students.
- Teachers can view, edit, or delete their meetings from the "All Meetings" page.

### B. Using Meeting Templates
- Teachers can create reusable meeting templates (e.g., for recurring classes or standard lesson formats).
- When scheduling a new meeting, teachers can select a template to pre-fill meeting details.
- Templates save time and ensure consistency across sessions.

### C. Bulk Scheduling
- Teachers can use the bulk schedule feature to create multiple meetings at once (e.g., a semester's worth of classes).
- Bulk scheduling can use templates for rapid setup.
- All bulk-scheduled meetings are linked to the relevant program and visible to students.

### D. Virtual Classes
- Teachers can create and manage virtual classes, linking them to specific programs and students.
- Each virtual class can have its own Zoom meeting link, schedule, and resources.

### E. Analytics and Attendance
- Teachers can view analytics for their meetings (attendance, engagement, etc.).
- Attendance is tracked automatically and can be reviewed per meeting or program.

## 2. Student Scenarios

### A. Viewing and Joining Meetings
- Students see a list of upcoming meetings for their enrolled programs.
- Each meeting entry includes the topic, time, and a "Join" button with the Zoom link.
- Students can view meeting resources and past meeting recordings if available.

### B. Attendance and Feedback
- Attendance is automatically logged when a student joins a meeting.
- After meetings, students can submit feedback or access shared resources.

### C. Notifications
- Students receive notifications (email or in-app) for upcoming meetings, changes, or cancellations.
